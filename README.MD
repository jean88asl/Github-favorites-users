# GitFav

GitFav is an application where you can add or remove your favorite GitHub users and access the favorites' profiles by clicking on their name or username. All profile information, such as name, user, repositories, and followers, is loaded after searching the data in the GitHub API. Another interesting point is that this information is saved in the browser, so when the user loads the website again, the data remains accessible. Cool, right!?
